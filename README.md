# VoiceKit
### AIY VoiceKit Mod

AIY's speaking voice isn't that good, but the voice recognition is great. The goal here is to add in as many useful speech command as possible.

By using VLC, youtube_dl and spotipy, I've added the ability to search for a spotify playlist and play through youtube streams.

### TODO
* Non-blocking thread to run VLC
* Podcasts
* Better Speech?
